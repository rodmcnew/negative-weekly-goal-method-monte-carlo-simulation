This is a small experiment that compares different methods of executing negative weekly goals.

This is also is Rod's first Vue.js project in order to try out Vue.js and try an ES6 module environment with no builds.

Notes:
- If running in WebStorm built-in server, debug mode must be used or the ES6 module loading will be blocked by WebStorm security
