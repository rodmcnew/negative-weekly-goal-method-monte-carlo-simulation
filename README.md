This is a small experiment that compares different methods of executing negative weekly goals.

This is also is Rod's first Vue.js project in order to try out Vue.js and build-less ES6.

Notes:
- If running in WebStorm built-in server, debug mode must be used or the ES6 module loading will be blocked by WebStorm security
